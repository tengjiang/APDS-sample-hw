    "本周的课程我们学习了工厂模式，现在我们来看另一种面向对象的编程模式的应用，即**命令模式/Command Pattern**。命令模式可以将一个“请求”封装为一个对象，从而让我们**用不同的请求对客户进行参数化**，对请求进行排队，记录请求日志，或是取消已经请求的操作（参考：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern or https://blog.csdn.net/zzl_python/article/details/82732266 ）。\n",

    "本次作业我们将用这种思路尝试完成一个简化后的股票交易所。Alice，Bob，Carol是三名股民，他们初始资金均为10000，交易所会记录他们提交的订单。为了简化模型，我们为股民免去了各种税费，且假设一共只有一支股票，每次的交易量均为1手（100股）。\n",
    "\n",
    "在第一部分，请完成交易所框架的搭建，实现模拟交易的过程。\n",
    "- 请完成框架，以BuyStockOrder类和SellStockOrder类的对象分别实现买卖股票的订单，并实例化三位股民；(1')\n",
    "- 请重写Agent类的str方法，将交易所记录的历史交易保存为trade.log并打印；(1')\n",
    "- 请重写StockTrade类的str方法，打印某一时刻各人的持股情况（初始持股数足够大，因此这里的持股情况可以小于0，且不用考虑t+1的限制）；(1')\n",
